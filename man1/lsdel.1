.SH NAME
lsdel \- list deleted files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsdel
[
.B \-d
] [
.B \-r
] filename ...
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lsdel
lists files that have been marked for deletion by the \fIdelete\fR(1)
program.
.PP
For information about using wildcards with \fIlsdel\fR, see
\fIundelete\fR(1).
.PP
Filenames passed to \fIlsdel\fR can be directories (non-deleted or
deleted) or deleted files.  If a non-deleted directory is specified,
lsdel lists the deleted contents of that directory.  If the
.BR \-r
option is specified, all non-deleted children of the directory will be
searched recursively for deleted files.
.PP
.I Lsdel
recursively lists deleted directories by default.  This can be
disabled with the
.BR \-d
option, which causes directory names, rather than their contents, to
be listed.
