			       OVERVIEW

This archive contains the sources for five programs (well, actually,
four, since one is a symbolic link):

	delete
	undelete
	expunge
	purge
	lsdel

The programs were written at Project Athena in response to the problem
which many novice Unix users have with accidentally deleting files
they didn't want to delete (Hell, I've done it :-).


			 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

I've personally compiled these sources under 4.3BSD on VAXen and IBM
RT/PC's, under Mach on the NeXT Machine, under Ultrix on the
DECstation 3100, and under SunOS 4.0, and I assume they should compile
with minimal trouble on other architectures.  If you make it compile
on another platform and you have to make changes, please send me
patches.


			 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

1. Compile the com_err library (see below for more details) found in
   the sub-directory et, and install it if you want to (you'll have to
   modify the delete Makefile a bit if you don't).

2. Edit the Makefile to fit your site.  See below for details.

3. Compile away!  Type "make" to make without installing, or "make
   install" to install binaries and man pages in the locations you
   specified when you edited the Makefile.


		       CUSTOMIZING THE MAKEFILE

You are probably going to have to do one or more of the following to
make the Makefile work for you.

1. Change the install binary directory and install man page directory
   (and possibly man section).

2. Change the "-I/usr/include" to point to the et subdirectory if you
   have not installed the com_err header file in a standard location,
   or to wherever you have installed it.  Change the COMPILE_ET
   variable to use et/compile_et if you haven't installed the
   compile_et utility.  Change the -L/usr/athena/lib flag to point to
   wherever you have installed the library, or to the et subdirectory
   if you have not.

3. Deal with the AFS_MOUNTPOINTS flag, which specifies whether
   undelete, expunge and lsdel will check for Andrew File System mount
   points in addition to standard Unix mount points.

   a. If you undefine it, remove the -I and -L flags that point to AFS
      includes and libraries, and remove the "-lsys" from the LIBS
      variable.

   b. If you leave it defined, change the -I and -L flags to point to
      wherever you keep your AFS includes and libraries.


			   COM_ERR LIBRARY

This is the second release of this package.  Unlike the first release,
this release requires (for error-handling) a library called com_err,
which was written by members of the MIT Student Information Processing
Board (SIPB).  Along with that library comes a utility called
compile_et.  The sources to the com_err library and compile_et are
included with the sources to the delete package; you should compile
them and then either install them in a "standard location" on your
machine or modify the delete Makefile so that it knows where they are.
The delete Makefile does not compile them by default, since they are
already compiled and installed at Athena, so you should compile and
install them separately from delete etc.

The files texinfo.tex and com_err.texinfo in the et sources are
compressed and uuencoded because they have control characters in them.
They have to be uudecoded and uncompressed before using them.  Neither
of them is necessary for just building the library and using it to
build delete et al -- they are just documentation about the library.


			     FINAL NOTES

The previous patch level I have on record is 2, but this is a whole
new release, so I've bumped up to 5 just to be confusing :-).  There
are, as far as I know, NO REAL PATCHES between 2 and 5, so don't go
sending me mail asking me if you've missed patches, especially since
this is a full distribution of the sources.

As usual, suggestions and bug fixes are always welcomed.
