This archives contains the sources for five programs (well, actually,
four, since one is a symbolic link):

	delete
	undelete
	expunge
	purge
	lsdel

The programs were written at Project Athena in response to the problem
which many novice Unix users have with accidentally deleting files
they didn't want to delete (Hell, I've done it :-).

I am already aware of quite a few improvements I could make in the
code (I am fairly certain that there are better regexp matching
libraries *and* better directory searching libraries I could be
using.), and I will be making them as soon as I am done with my
current project.  I would appreciate hearing any suggestions you may
have and/or accepting any patches you wish to submit :-)

I've only compiled these under 4.3BSD on VAXen and IBM RT/PC's, as
well as on Mach on the NeXT Machine, but I assume they should compile
with minimal trouble on other architectures (does SysV have the
re_comp and re_exec procedures for regular expression matching?).

If you make it compile on another platform and you have to make
changes, please send me patches.
