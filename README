			       OVERVIEW

This archives contains the sources for five programs (well, actually,
four, since one is a symbolic link):

	delete
	undelete
	expunge
	purge
	lsdel

The programs were written at Project Athena in response to the problem
which many novice Unix users have with accidentally deleting files
they didn't want to delete (Hell, I've done it :-).


			 SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

I've personally compiled these sources under 4.3BSD on VAXen and IBM
RT/PC's, as well as under Mach on the NeXT Machine and under Ultrix on
the DECstation 3100, and I assume they should compile with minimal
trouble on other architectures.  If you make it compile on another
platform and you have to make changes, please send me patches.


			 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

1. Compile the com_err library (see below for more details) found in
   the sub-directory et, and either install it in a standard location
   on your machine or change the delete Makefile to point to the et
   sub-directory when looking for the com_err library, include
   files, and compile_et utility.

2. Edit the Makefile to fit your site.  This probably means changing
   the install target directory, and undefining the symbol
   AFS_MOUNTPOINTS.  If you leave AFS_MOUNTPOINTS defined (presumably
   because your site has the andrew file system and the libraries
   which accompany it), change INCLUDES and LIBDIRS to point to your
   AFS sources.  If you undefine it, delete "-lsys" from the LIBS
   variable.

3. Compile away!


			   COM_ERR LIBRARY

This is the second release of this package.  Unlike the first release,
this release requires (for error-handling) a library called com_err,
which was written by members of the MIT Student Information Processing
Board (SIPB).  Along with that library comes a utility called
compile_et.  The sources to the com_err library and compile_et are
included with the sources to the delete package; you should compile
them and then either install them in a "standard location" on your
machine or modify the delete Makefile so that it knows where they are.
The delete Makefile does not compile them by default, since they are
already compiled and installed at Athena, so you should compile and
install them separately from delete etc.

The files texinfo.tex and com_err.texinfo in the et sources are
compressed and uuencoded because they have control characters in them.
They have to be uudecoded and uncompressed before using them.  Neither
of them is necessary for just building the library and using it to
build delete et al -- they are just documentation about the library.


			     FINAL NOTES

The previous patch level I have on record is 2, but this is a whole
new release, so I've bumped up to 5 just to be confusing :-).  There
are, as far as I know, NO REAL PATCHES between 2 and 5, so don't go
sending me mail asking me if you've missed patches, especially since
this is a full distribution of the sources.

As usual, suggestions and bug fixes are always welcomed.
