This archives contains the sources for five programs (well, actually,
four, since one is a symbolic link):

	delete
	undelete
	expunge
	purge
	lsdel

The programs were written at Project Athena in response to the problem
which many novice Unix users have with accidentally deleting files
they didn't want to delete (Hell, I've done it :-).

This is the second release of this package.  Unlike the first release,
this release requires (for error-handling) a library called com_err,
which was written by members of the MIT Student Information Processing
Board (SIPB).  Along with that library comes a utility called
compile_et.  The sources to the com_err library and compile_et are
included with the sources to the delete package; you should compile
them and then either install them in a "standard location" on your
machine or modify the delete Makefile so that it knows where they are.
The delete Makefile does not compile them by default, since they are
already compiled and installed at Athena, so you should compile and
install them separately from delete etc.

As usual, suggestions and bug fixes are always welcomed.

I've personally compiled these sources under 4.3BSD on VAXen and IBM
RT/PC's, as well as under Mach on the NeXT Machine and under Ultrix on
the DECstation 3100, and I assume they should compile with minimal
trouble on other architectures.  If you make it compile on another
platform and you have to make changes, please send me patches.

You'll probably want to edit the Makefile to more accurately reflect
your site.  Also, you're almost definitely going to want to undefine
the AFS_MOUNTPOINTS symbol enabled in the Makefile.  If your site
*does* have the Andrew File System, and you want lsdel, expunge and
undelete to detect AFS mount points, you can leave it defined.  In
either case, you are going to have to modify LDFLAGS and INCLUDES to
either point to the right directory for AFS libraries and include
files, or not mention AFS at all.
