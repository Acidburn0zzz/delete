Description: A friendlier version of rm for Athena
 The delete utility marks files and directories for later permanent 
 removal by prefixing them with '.#'.  Files accidentally marked for 
 deletion can be recovered with undelete.  Permanent removal can be 
 effected immediately with the purge and expunge commands.  The lsdel 
 utility lists the files that have been marked for deletion but not yet 
 removed.
