		       ABOUT THE COM_ERR LIBARY

  The com_err library was written by members of the Student
Information Processing Board (SIPB) at MIT, to provide a useful
standardized method for dealing with program errors when writing
software.

  The version of com_err contained here is currently in flux; the
original authors are working on enhancements, although no definite
release date for them has been set.  You should be aware that when the
new version comes out, the programming interface to the library may
change slightly or not-so-slightly, depending on what the authors feel
is needed.

  The file com_err.texinfo (and texinfo.tex, for processing it)
contains the detailed documenation for the library.  They may be
compressed and uuencoded when you receive them, since they contain
some control characters in their original form.


			     BUILDING IT

  It should be relatively easy to compile the com_err package on most
architectures.  To do so, make the following changes to the Makefile:

1. Change RANLIB from "ranlib" to some innocuous command like "echo"
   if you don't have ranlib on your system.

2. If your system is System V based, add "-DSYSV" to DEFINES.

3. If you plan on installing the library, include files,
   documentation and compile_et program, change BINDIR, INCDIR,
   LIBDIR, and DOCDIR.

After that, you should be all set.


			      QUESTIONS?

  I didn't write com_err, but I'm willing to answer questions and/or
direct them to someone who can.  See my signature to find out how to
